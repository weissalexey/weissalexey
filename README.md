- 👋 Hi, I’m Alex Weiss @weissalexey
-    ich bin Alex Weiss 
-    Salut, je suis Alex Weiss
-    Привет друзья я Алексей Веис
- 👀 I worked as a programmer in Russia for a long time.  
     Basically I am interested in the Data Science direction.  
     I am going to use this hub as a repository for my old code.  
     All files that you find here have lost their relevance and 
     everyone who wants to can use it for free.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python
